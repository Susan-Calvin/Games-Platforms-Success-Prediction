|Games Platforms Success Prediction|Final project of the first module|Analysis of data from online store on sales of games platforms around the world to identify a potentially popular games |python, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, sidetable, regular expressions, math, sqaurify, functools|
# Description:
We work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. We need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
In front of us is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and we’re planning a campaign for 2017.
